          <li>Tajriba darajasi, jinsi va o‘zini ifoda etishi, jinsiy orientatsiyasi, nogironligi, tashqi ko‘rinishi, tana o‘lchami, irqi, etnik kelib chiqishi, yoshi, dini, milliy kelib chiqishi yoki boshqa shunga o‘xshash xususiyatlaridan qat’i nazar, hamma uchun do‘stona, xavfsiz va mehmondo‘st muhitni ta’minlashga intilamiz.</li>
          <li>Iltimos, hamma uchun do'stona, xavfsiz va mehmondo'st muhitni buzishi mumkin bo'lgan shahvoniy taxalluslar yoki boshqa taxalluslardan foydalanmang.</li>
          <li>Iltimos, mehribon va xushmuomala bo'ling. Qo'pol yoki jaxldor bo'lishga hojat yo'q.</li>
          <li>Odamlarning fikrlari turlicha ekanligini va har bir dizayn yoki amalga oshirish tanlovi o'zaro kelishuv va ko'p xarajatlarga olib kelishini hurmat qiling. Kamdan-kam hollarda to'g'ri javob bo'ladi.</li>
          <li>Iltimos, tuzilmagan tanqidni minimal darajada saqlang. Agar sizda tajriba o'tkazmoqchi bo'lgan qat'iy g'oyalaringiz bo'lsa, forklar yasang va uning qanday ishlashini ko'ring.</li>
          <li>Agar siz kimnidir xafa qilsangiz, kamsitsangiz yoki xafa qilsangiz, biz sizni muloqotdan chetlatamiz. Bu yaxshi xatti-harakatlar emas. Biz "bezorilik" atamasini <a href="https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md dagi ta'rifni o'z ichiga olgan holda izohlaymiz">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; Agar siz ushbu kontseptsiyaga nimani kiritish mumkinligini aniq bilmasangiz, ularning ta'rifini o'qing. Xususan, biz ijtimoiy jihatdan marginal guruhlardagi odamlarni istisno qiladigan xatti-harakatlarga toqat qilmaymiz.</li>
          <li>Shaxsiy ta'qiblar ham qabul qilinishi mumkin emas. Kim bo‘lishingizdan qat’iy nazar, agar siz hamjamiyat a’zosi tomonidan bezovta qilgandek yoki bezovta qilayotganini his qilsangiz, darhol kanal xodimlaridan biri yoki { $coc-rust-moderation-team-anchor } bilan bog‘laning. Doimiy ishtirokchi boʻlasizmi yoki yangi kelgan boʻlasizmi, biz bu hamjamiyatni siz uchun xavfsiz joyga aylantirish haqida qaygʻuramiz va biz sizni qoʻllab-quvvatlaymiz.</li>
          <li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.</li>

        <p>Bular jamiyatimizning xulq-atvor standartlarini qo'llab-quvvatlash siyosatidir. Agar mavzu moderatsiyaga muhtoj deb hisoblasangiz, { $coc-rust-moderation-team-anchor } bilan bog‘laning.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)</li>
          <li>Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.</li>
          <li>Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.</li>
          <li>If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.</li>
          <li>If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.</li>
          <li>Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.</li>
          <li>If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, <strong>in private</strong>. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.</li>
          <li>Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the Rust community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.</p>
        <p>And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow Rustaceans comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.</p>
        <p>The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Rust venues; including Discord channels (https://discord.gg/rust-lang); GitHub repositories under rust-lang, rust-lang-nursery, and rust-lang-deprecated; and all forums under rust-lang.org (users.rust-lang.org, internals.rust-lang.org). For other projects adopting the Rust Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.</p>
